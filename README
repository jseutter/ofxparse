ofxparse
========

ofxparse is a parser for Open Financial Exchange (.ofx) format files.  OFX files
are available from almost any online banking site, so they work well if you 
want to pull together your finances from multiple sources.  Online trading accounts
also provide account statements in OFX files.

There are three different types of OFX files.  This library has been tested with
BankAccount files.  The other two types, CreditAccount and InvestmentAccount have
not been tested.  If you have a sample of these other types that could be used to
help this project, please see the Help! section below.

Example Usage
=============

Here's a sample program::

  from ofxparse import OfxParser

  ofx = OfxParser.parse(file('file.ofx'))
  ofx.account                         # An account with information
  ofx.account.number                  # The account number
  ofx.account.routing_number          # The transit id (sometimes called branch number)
  ofx.account.statement               # Account information for a period of time
  ofx.account.statement.start_date    # The start date of the transactions
  ofx.account.statement.end_date      # The end date of the transactions
  ofx.account.statement.transactions  # A list of account activities
  ofx.account.statement.balance       # The money in the account as of the statement date
  ofx.account.statement.available_balance # The money available from the account as of the statement date

Help!
=====

I'm looking for different types of accounts to make this library more robust.  I'm looking for sample
credit account or investment account files.  Please (anonymize first) and mail to jseutter dot ofxparse
at gmail dot com.

Tests
=====

Run the tests with python::

  python -m unittest tests.test_parse

license text.  The basic idea is that if you can use Python to do what you are
doing, you can also use this library.
